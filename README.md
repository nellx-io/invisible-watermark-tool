# 🔒 Invisible Watermark Tool

Secure your images like a digital creator should.  
This tool embeds an **invisible, encrypted watermark** into images using:

- 🧠 SHA-256 hashing (for unique creator ID)
- 🔐 AES-256 encryption (for watermark confidentiality)
- 🧾 Logging system (to track embed/verify events)
- ⏱️ Timestamp ledger (to prove when a file was watermarked)

> Built modularly and transparently using Python + OpenAI guidance.

## 👤 Creator Note

This project was built in real-time through hands-on testing, terminal navigation, and guided iteration with ChatGPT (OpenAI). It represents both technical functionality and a philosophy:  
**Digital sovereignty + creative authorship = protection + power.**
